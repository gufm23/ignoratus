# Ignoratus
The Ignoratus project uses open source available software to create a hidden VPN that can bypass almost all firewall systems. A skilled developer could design and implement something like this, but the aim here is to provide a simple guide for not so advanced users to use the project. With this, comes a well documented guide and a script that installs the system.

The software used in this project are:
[wstunnel](https://github.com/erebe/wstunnel/)https://github.com/erebe/wstunnel/)
[dnslookup](https://github.com/ameshkov/dnslookup)
Other software already provided in the Debin repositories, specially Wireguard and Python.
